# EV3 Robot Line Follower

## Overview

This project utilizes an EV3 robot with the Lejos software to follow a black line on a white surface. The robot is equipped with various sensors and motors to accomplish this task efficiently. Additionally, the robot is capable of detecting obstacles in its path and navigating around them to ensure successful completion of its journey.

## Features

- **Line Following**: The robot is programmed to follow a black line on a white surface using color sensors and motor control.
- **Obstacle Detection**: The robot can detect obstacles in its path and navigate around them to avoid collisions.
- **LCD Display**: Clear instructions and information, including total journey time, are displayed on an LCD screen.
- **Modular Development**: The project is divided into distinct parts, with each team member focusing on specific components:
  - Keya: Color sensor and motor-related parts.
  - Neeru: LCD display information and obstacle detection.
  - Rochan: Motor control, sound, line following, and obstacle avoidance.
  - Alexey: Obstacle detection.

## Usage

To use the EV3 robot line follower:

1. Ensure the robot is powered on and connected to the appropriate hardware.
2. Start the program on the EV3 brick or through the Lejos software.
3. Follow on-screen instructions for starting and stopping the robot.
4. Monitor the LCD display for real-time information and updates.
5. Enjoy watching the robot successfully follow the black line and navigate around obstacles!
